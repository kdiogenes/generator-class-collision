This application has a `UsersController`, when running `rails g scaffold_controller name:string email:string` the output
is the following:

```bash
Running via Spring preloader in process 12011

```

In the last line is a message generated by `check_class_collision` method used in helper generator. This method is
also used in the [scaffold controller generator](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/scaffold_controller/scaffold_controller_generator.rb#L10), but doesn't generate a similar message for the
`UsersController` due the issue presented in https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/37543, the generator checks the
controller name in the singular, although the generated files are all in the plural.

In this same application if you run `rails g controller Users name:string email:string` you get:

```bash
The name 'UsersController' is either already used in your application or reserved by Ruby on Rails. Please choose an alternative and run this generator again.
